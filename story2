Once upon a time in a forest, there lived a monkey who was very fond of planting trees.One day, he decided to plant a fruit tree
on the banks of the river in the middle of the forest. Years later, when the tree finally started bearing fruits, the crocodile,
ennticed by the sweet smell, found his way under the fruit tree. The kind-hearted monkey offered some of the fruits to him."
