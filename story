STORY

Once upon a time in a forest, there lived a monkey who was very fond of planting trees.One day, he decided to plant a fruit tree
on the banks of the river in the middle of the forest. Years later, when the tree finally started bearing fruits, the crocodile
enticed by the sweet smell, found his way under the fruit tree. The kind-hearted monkey offered some of the fruits to him."I
haven't tasted fruits as sweet as these", said the crocodile. "You can come over any day and we can feast on these fruits", said
the monkey. This marked the beginning of a new friendship.
